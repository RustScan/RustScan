RustScan is always looking for contributors. Whether that's spelling mistakes or major changes, your help is **wanted** and welcomed here.

Before contributing, read our [code of conduct](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

TL;DR if you abuse members of our community you will be **perma-banned** with no chance to get unbanned. No warnings either. ðŸ¤—

RustScan has 2 major labels for GitHub issues you should look at:
* Good First issue
These are issues for newcomers to open source!
[https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
* Help wanted
These are issues that aren't really for newcomers, but we could still do with help!
[https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

If you want to, solve the issue or comment on the issue for help.

The [flow for contributing](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) to open source software is:
* Fork the repo
* Make changes
* Pull request to the repo

And then comment on the issue that you've done.

RustScan also has some `// TODO`'s in the codebase, which are meant more for the core team but we wouldn't say no to help with these issues.

If you have any feature suggestions or bugs, leave a GitHub issue. We welcome any and all support :D

## Rewarding you
I cannot pay you :-( But, I can place your GitHub profile on the README under `#Contributors` as a thank you! :)
